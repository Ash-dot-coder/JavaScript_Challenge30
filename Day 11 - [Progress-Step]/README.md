## 🚀 Progress Step Animation - Day 11 of JavaScript Challenge
Welcome to Day 11 of my 30-day JavaScript Challenge! This project showcases a Progress Step Animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a simple, yet effective way to visually track progress through multiple steps, with interactive controls and smooth animations to enhance user experience.

# 🌟 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a progress bar that dynamically updates as users navigate through steps. Here are some of the key features:

- Interactive Controls:
    - Users can move between steps using the Next and Prev buttons.
    - The buttons are enabled or disabled based on the current step to prevent unwanted actions.
- Smooth Animations:
    - CSS transitions ensure a seamless experience as users move through the steps.
- Responsive Design:
    - The layout adapts fluidly to different screen sizes, maintaining a clean and professional look.


# 📋 Technologies Used
- HTML: Structure and layout of the progress steps.
- CSS: Styling, transitions, and responsive design using CSS variables.
- JavaScript: Event handling and DOM manipulation for button interactions and progress updates.

# 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ash-dot-coder/progress-step-animation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
