# JavaScript Challenge 30 üöÄ

Welcome to my **JavaScript Challenge 30**, where I am enhancing my JavaScript skills through various projects over 30 days. Each day focuses on a different project, showcasing different functionalities and learning outcomes.

## Day 3 - Visual Tuner üé®

Welcome to my **Day 3 project** of the JavaScript Learning Challenge! In this project, I developed an interactive tool called **Visual Tuner**, allowing users to manipulate various visual aspects of an image in real-time. 

## Project Overview

**Visual Tuner** provides a dynamic interface where users can adjust:
- **Spacing**: Modify the margins and padding around the image.
- **Blur Effect**: Control the intensity of the blur applied to the image.
- **Base Color**: Change the color of the text and frame dynamically.

This project showcases the capabilities of JavaScript and CSS to create engaging and interactive web experiences.

## Features

- **Real-Time Updates**: Adjustments to spacing, blur, and color are applied instantly, providing immediate visual feedback.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Sliders and color pickers offer an intuitive way to explore various effects.
- **Responsive Design**: The tool is designed to work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
