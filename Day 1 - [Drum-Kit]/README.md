# JavaScript Challenge 30 🚀

Welcome to my **JavaScript Challenge 30**, where I am enhancing my JavaScript skills through various projects over 30 days. Each day focuses on a different project, showcasing different functionalities and learning outcomes.

## Day 1: Drum Kit Project 🎵

Welcome to the **Drum Kit** project, a fun and interactive experience where each letter on your keyboard corresponds to a different drum sound. Press any of the displayed letters to hear the associated sound, creating your own beats!

## 🖥️ Project Preview

Here's a snapshot of the Drum Kit interface:

(The above image shows the layout, where pressing any letter key such as **A**, **S**, **D**, etc., triggers drum sounds like clap, hi-hat, kick, etc.)

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Interactive Sound Effects**: Each alphabet key corresponds to a unique drum sound.
- **Visual Feedback**: When a key is pressed, its corresponding button is highlighted, offering a visual cue.
- **Simple Design**: The UI is built to be minimalistic and user-friendly, focusing on the experience of creating beats.
- **Audio Integration**: Enjoy a real-time audio response as you press each key.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for the buttons and overall design.
- **JavaScript**: Used to handle the sound effects and interactions with key presses.
