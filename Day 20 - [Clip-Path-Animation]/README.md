# 🟠 Day 20 | Clip Path Animation 🎨

## 📜 **Project Overview**
This project is part of my **30 Days of JavaScript Challenge** and focuses on creating a **Clip Path Animation** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The goal of this challenge was to implement dynamic and interactive animations, enhancing user experience through visual effects. The clip path effect tracks the mouse cursor and reacts to both hover and click events.
