#  ⏳ Day 14 - Lazy Loading | JavaScript Challenge 30

🚀 **Day 14 of my 30-Day JavaScript Challenge: Lazy Loading**  
A project demonstrating the implementation of lazy loading using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project is part of my commitment to mastering JavaScript through a structured challenge, enhancing my front-end development skills and creating interactive user experiences.

## 🌟 **Project Overview**
This project showcases a **lazy loading effect** where a background image gradually comes into focus as the loading percentage increases. The loading text dynamically updates, creating a visually appealing and interactive experience.
