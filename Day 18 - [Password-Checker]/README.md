# 🔒 Day 18 - Password Checker

Welcome to **Day 18** of my **#30DaysOfJavaScript** Challenge! 🚀 In this project, I've created a **Password Checker** web page that validates user passwords based on multiple criteria using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 📝 Project Overview

The **Password Checker** project is a web-based tool that allows users to test the strength of their passwords. It evaluates passwords based on the presence of:
- ✅ Uppercase letters
- ✅ Lowercase letters
- ✅ Numbers
- ✅ Special characters

## 🔧 Features

- **Dynamic Password Validation**: The webpage validates the password as you type, checking for:
  - ✅ Uppercase letters
  - ✅ Lowercase letters
  - ✅ Numbers
  - ✅ Special characters
- **Toggle Password Visibility**: An eye icon 👁️ allows users to toggle between showing and hiding the password.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Icons and text update instantly to indicate which password criteria are met.
- **Interactive Animation**: A subtle animation effect is applied to enhance the user experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Markup structure for the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for the layout, input field, and validation states.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for password validation and interactivity.

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Input Field**: The user enters a password in the input field.
2. **Validation Rules**: JavaScript checks for:
   - At least one uppercase letter
   - At least one lowercase letter
   - At least one number
   - At least one special character
3. **Real-time Updates**: The page updates icons and validation messages dynamically as the user types.
4. **Password Toggle**: Users can click on the eye icon to toggle visibility.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally
