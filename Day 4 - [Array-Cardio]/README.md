# JavaScript Challenge 30 ðŸš€

Welcome to my **JavaScript Challenge 30**, where I am enhancing my JavaScript skills through various projects over 30 days. Each day focuses on a different project, showcasing different functionalities and learning outcomes.

## Day 4 : Array Cardio Part-1 ðŸŒŸ

## Project Overview

**Array Cardio Part-1** is a JavaScript project that focuses on manipulating arrays to gain insights into notable inventors and their contributions to technology and computing. This project allows users to explore various data operations, including filtering, mapping, sorting, and reducing, to enhance their understanding of JavaScript's array methods.

## Project Features

- **Filter Inventors Born in the 1900s**: Identify inventors born between 1900 and 1960.
- ![First:](<Assets/images/1 - filter.png>)
- **Map Full Names**: Create a list of full names for all inventors.
- ![Second:](<Assets/images/2 - map.png>)
- **Sort by Birthdate**: Organize inventors from oldest to youngest based on their birth year.
- ![Third:](<Assets/images/3 - sort.png>)
- **Calculate Total Years Lived**: Sum the total years lived by all inventors.
- ![Fourth:](<Assets/images/4 - reduce.png>)
- **Sort by Years Lived**: Rank inventors by the number of years they lived, showcasing their legacies.
- ![Fifth:](<Assets/images/5 - sort.png>)
- **Filter Programming Languages**: Extract programming languages containing "Java" from a list.
- ![Sixth:](<Assets/images/6 - filter.png>)
- **Sort People Alphabetically**: Arrange a list of notable figures by their last names.
- ![Seventh:](<Assets/images/7 - sort.png>)
- **Count Instances of Tech Usage**: Count how many times each tech item is mentioned in a dataset.
- ![Eighth:](<Assets/images/8 - reduce.png>)

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I have:

- Enhanced my understanding of JavaScript array methods and their practical applications.
- Improved my data manipulation skills by performing various operations on arrays.
- Developed a deeper appreciation for the innovative minds that have shaped our digital landscape.
