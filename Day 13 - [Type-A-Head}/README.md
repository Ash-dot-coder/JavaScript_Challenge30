# Day 13: 30 Days JavaScript Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **JavaScript Challenge 30** repository! This project is part of my journey to master JavaScript by completing 30 hands-on projects over 30 days. Each day focuses on building a unique JavaScript feature or application to improve my skills and knowledge in web development.

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository contains 30 different JavaScript projects. Each folder represents a day and showcases a specific challenge or task. The projects aim to enhance my understanding of core JavaScript concepts, including:

- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Fetch API usage
- CSS integration with JavaScript
- Interactive web components

These projects are designed to be small, interactive, and easy to understand for anyone learning JavaScript.

### 🔍 Day 13 - Type Ahead

Day 13 focuses on building a **Type Ahead** feature. This project allows users to search for cities or states in real-time, providing suggestions as they type. It demonstrates how to use the **Fetch API** to retrieve data, manipulate it, and display interactive results on the UI.

**Live Demo**: [Day 13 - Type Ahead](https://ash-dot-coder.github.io/JavaScript_Challenge30/Day%2013%20-%20%5BType-A-Head%7D/index.html)

### 💻 Code Details

1. **HTML**: 
   - Structured a search form with an input field and an unordered list (`<ul>`) to display the filtered suggestions.
   
2. **CSS**: 
   - Styled the search form, input field, and suggestions list to provide a clean and modern UI.
   - Applied gradient effects and box shadows to enhance the visual aesthetics of the suggestions list.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - Utilized the Fetch API to retrieve city and state data from an external endpoint.
   - Implemented functions for real-time search matching using regular expressions.
   - Dynamically updated the UI based on user input to create an interactive experience.
